# SuperSilenceDetector

This is a MacOs program to detect silence in an audio source and alert by email if any is detected.

It is _not_ in active developement as it's considered stable enough for our needs, but contribution are welcomed.

This code is curently in use at CHYZ 94,3 FM, Qu√©bec City, Canada. It's been created by Johnny Tremblay.
